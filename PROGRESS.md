## Environment Setup
- [x] Python 3.12 installed via Homebrew
- [x] VS Code configured with Python extensions
- [x] Git installed and configured
- [x] GitHub repository created: healthcare-python-learning
- [x] Personal access token configured for GitHub CLI

## Skills Learned
- Variables and data types (int, float, str, bool)
- Arithmetic operators
- User input with input()
- Type conversion with int() and float()
- F-strings for output formatting
- Conditional statements (if/elif/else)
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators (and, or)
- Lists (append, remove, indexing, len)
- While loops with break
- For loops
- Dictionaries (creating, accessing, updating, iterating)
- Use if/elif/else for decision making
- Work with lists (append, iterate, len)
- Work with dictionaries (create, access, update)
- Combine lists and dictionaries
- Use while loops with break
- Use for loops to iterate through collections

## Notes
- Using snake_case for variable names (Python convention)
- Remember .items() when looping through dictionary key-value pairs
- Check boundary conditions when writing conditional logic
- Indentation matters in Python - use 4 spaces consistently
